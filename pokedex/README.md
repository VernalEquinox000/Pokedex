# Welcome to Pokedex

This is a basic version of the Pokedex, using React App and Pokemon API [https://pokeapi.co]

## The project

In the homepage, you'll be able to fetch the complete list of Pokemon available, choose the ones you "catch" and see a list of those you've caught and those you are looking for.

You can easily add a Pokemon by clicking on the "Take Me!" button. You can check the details of every pokemon by clicking on their name and be redirected to the Details page.
